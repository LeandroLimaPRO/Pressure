# 💻😷 Library for NXP differential pressure sensors
### project resulting from the hidden pandemic, by the MakersMA group. Released for use, provided that it assigns the copyright to the repository dententor.
## Summary 
library for reading differential pressure / gauge sensors from the manufacturer NXP. With pressure return in KPA, PSI, BAR, CMH2O quantities.

### Basic Library step-by-step
-  Call the library and create a Pressure object, containing at least the address of the analog port to which the sensor is located.

```C++
#include "Pressure.h"

Pressure Sensor(A0);
``` 
Or with the help of a multimeter take the operating voltage from the microcontroller to calibrate the sensor:

```C++
#include "Pressure.h"

Pressure Sensor(A0, 4.85);
```

-  Insert the `Init ()` function in the arduino setup

```C++
void setup(){
Sensor.Init();
}
```
- Use `Get(MODEL,TYPE OF PRESSURE MEASUREMENT)` to obtain the pressure value. Do this by entering two information 1- Sensor model and 2 - response magnitude.

```C++
void loop(){
float value = Sensor.Get(MXP5010,BAR);
}
```
